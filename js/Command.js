        "<span id='Topic'>discrete mathematics : </span>",
        "<span>During my Bachelor of Technology (BUT) program, I had the opportunity to study discrete mathematics. This course allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of mathematical structures and their applications in computer science. I learned about topics such as graph theory, combinatorics, and number theory, and how they relate to various areas of computer science, such as algorithms, cryptography, and computer networks. This knowledge has proven to be invaluable in my career as a computer science professional, as I am able to apply these concepts to solve complex problems and develop innovative solutions. Overall, studying discrete mathematics has been a challenging and rewarding experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have learned about this fascinating field of study.</span>",
        '<br>',
        "<span id='Topic'>Programmation : </span>",

        "<span>During my studies, I had the opportunity to learn about both imperative programming and object-oriented programming. In terms of imperative programming, I studied the C language and its capabilities. This allowed me to develop a deeper understanding of imperative programming concepts and techniques such as loops, conditional statements, and functions. In addition to that, I also learned about system programming using C, which helped me gain insights into how computers interact with hardware and how low-level programming works.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Regarding object-oriented programming, I studied the SOLID principles, which are a set of guidelines for creating robust, maintainable, and extensible software systems. These principles include Single Responsibility Principle, Open/Closed Principle, Liskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segregation Principle, and Dependency Inversion Principle. By learning these principles, I was able to understand how to design and implement object-oriented software in a more efficient and effective manner.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Furthermore, I also developed knowledge in RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization) in C++, which is a programming technique that manages resources (such as memory or file handles) automatically through object lifetimes. This allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of how to manage resources effectively in object-oriented programming.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Overall, my education in imperative programming with C and system programming, as well as my education in object-oriented programming with SOLID principles and knowledge in RAII(C++), have been instrumental in my career as a programmer, enabling me to develop complex and efficient software solutions.</span>",
        '<br>',
        "<span id='Topic'>Information System (Reix,Alter) : </span>",

        "<span>" +
        "During my studies, I delved into the world of Information Systems, which can be defined as \"an organized set of resources (people, data, and technology) that collects, transforms, and disseminates information in an organization to support decision-making and control\" (Reix, 1997).\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Through this definition, I learned that Information Systems are not just about technology, but also about the people and processes that are involved in collecting and utilizing data to support decision-making. This holistic approach to Information Systems emphasized the importance of understanding not only the technical aspects of information management but also the organizational context in which it is implemented.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Furthermore, I gained an appreciation for the strategic importance of Information Systems in modern organizations. By providing timely and accurate information to support decision-making, Information Systems can help organizations gain a competitive advantage in a rapidly evolving business landscape.\n" +
        "\n" +
        "Overall, my education in Information Systems based on Reix's definition has enabled me to understand the crucial role of technology, people, and processes in managing information and supporting decision-making in organizations.</span>",
